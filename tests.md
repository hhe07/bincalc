# Tests:

Takes user input: 2
Inputted numbers correct: 0xf, 0b100
Newline a bunch of times to demonstrate

Shuntyard works, operators accepted, correct solution:

(note with and without spaces)
(0b100 && 0xf) - 2 = 2
0b100 || 8 + 3 * 2 = 14
(2+3)^5 >> 1 = 1562
(6/!2) << 0b1 = 12
(x && 4) >> 1 = 2
"exit" command works

Tokenizer works: unit tests
Helper functions work: unit tests

Demonstrate Extensibility in unit tests, symbol recognition, etc. in spite of lack of constant lists
